I remain open to an in person greeting if the guest requests it and is willing to join me in masking.

I have been hosting on Airbnb for 10 years and have had wonderful guests from all across the U.S. and the world: Canada, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Norway, England, Korea, Australia and Germany to name a few. I have truly enjoyed these wonderful people and look forward to meeting  more of the Airbnb community and hosting you in my beautiful private studio. I recently added an additional option for guests.

Should you choose to stay in my private guest studio, you will find a private area  for your use. I live above the ground floor studio that is listed. If you choose to stay in the 3rd floor guestroom, that guest shares space with the host.

I am very well travelled- 21 National Parks in the US, several in other countries. I justed returned from my first trip after vaccination. I visited Redwoods National Park in May of 2021.  
I love hiking, backpacking, and generally being outdoors. I have river rafted the Grand Canyon and also in Alaska. If you are coming to Seattle and hope to visit Olympic, Mt Rainier, or North Cascades National parks, I can provide a little local insight. 

I love living in a vibrant urban village. My area has all amenities within walking distance, and this is important to me. I try to drive as little as possible, and for the past 5 years, I have driven less than 3,000 miles per year!

I am an avid tomato grower, so in the summer months, you will see dozens of varieties growing in my very small urban farm. I also grow garlic, onions, potatoes, and some years I grow peppers.

I am a good cook (using all my great organic veggies) but I will not be providing breakfast except in very special circumstances.

I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. 

My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2020 Holiday Season
Holiday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the annual Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2020 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  

Summer Solstice
The famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  Creator of the Ice Queenistas 2009-2012  I was an Ice Queen Clown in 2014  and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  

The Neighborhood
As to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a great view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

FOODIE w/o gluten!!
After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

Favorite coffee - Lighthouse Roaster from right up the street at 43rd and Phinney.
Favorite view - from the sun dial at the top of Gas Works Park hill.
Favorite Seattle park - Discovery Park
What I think about Eastern WA - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in Seattle, there's nearly always SUN!

How I feel about Puget Sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an Island or the Olympic Penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me happy.  Mt. Rainier is my sacred mountain - it calls me each year at least once to hike or snowshoe and feel the awesome presence of its magnetic core.  

I love traveling in France and Europe in general, Mexico, the American West and Southwest, and now, South America.  My favorite way to travel is to friends or family who live there.  Or with a group of like minded people on a small group tour.  Or by car locally and in the Southwest where the wide open spaces bring freedom to my soul.",100,87

One of my biggest pleasures in life is learning about a new place, new people, new food- both through my own travels and as a host.  My friends would describe me as active, open, engaging, funny and liberal. I was raised in the deep South of the USA (Georgia), the youngest of 5 siblings, but have lived in Seattle for 25+ years. Seattle is a hot bed of music talent, and I take advantage of it by staying updated on emerging talent and attending as many live performances as I can. I am often the oldest person there, but so what! You could not ask for a better city to live in if you are a foodie, as I am.  The variety here is unbelievable. My profession is Interior Design, so of course, design and art are an important part of my life. Books, and more books- don't even try to talk to me if I have a book in my hand!

I have three absolutely gorgeous and brilliant daughters who no longer live with me, which naturally makes them even more attractive! They live in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I visit them often.

I love hiking, camping, and staying places off the beaten tourist path. I will always choose a host over a hotel- how better to really learn something about the place you bothered to travel?

Once upon a time, I spoke pretty decent Italian, but am rusty and out of practice. I would love some Italian guests to practice with (or rather, ""with whom to practice"", as I will claim to be a grammar expert). My French is even rustier. I have begun to study Spanish recently.

In addition to being hosts, we are frequent Airbnb guests. We first stayed at an Airbnb location in Sydney, Australia, while honeymooning in January 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, Australia, to include a handful of locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities throughout the U.S. and also other countries including Tanzania, France, Canada, England, The Netherlands, and Germany. We've been a guest in more than 40 different Airbnb locations over the past 9 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!

Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb. Hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.

We are avid travelers and are also are very tidy and respectful. Beyond travelling, we like listening to live music, exploring neighborhoods, having fun with our dogs, gardening and cooking great food, spending time near the water/beach, and meeting new people.",100,92

3118422,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3118422,Julie,7/31/12,"Welcome to my home! Let's get to the fun part:

I have to say one thing first: I love pork. There's nothing better than roasted pork tenderloin, perhaps wrapped in bacon with a honey, balsamic vinegar, and red wine sauce. I could eat pork for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Sometimes, I feel bad about that because my grandma was Jewish, but she served ham on holidays sooooo. But I sometimes try to be a vegetarian for the environment, and it's so haaaard.

I'm from California, so I'm not a typical Northwestern person. I like recycling, but composting is the absolute worst. (Update: I now compost!) I also like saving the world and being green friendly, but I'm very cheap and hate buying more expensive green products. 

I love to travel and experience new things. I'm always looking for an inexpensive getaway for a week or weekend. (We may have that in common?) I'm also an introvert, which makes me a bit of a contradiction since I'm really loud and sometimes obnoxious. 

My life motto: Don't be an a-hole. And that is the truth. (My therapist said I had to choose a more positive mantra. Eh) I also believe you should live your damn life as much as you can. It's short. Be who you are, not who you think others want you to be. 

People tell me I'm funny. It's true. I am funny. Someone told me I'm captivating once too. That just made me roll my eyes.

I am a fanboy for Jurassic Park. It's my favorite movie, and I will not tolerate anyone disliking it! 

I'm also a ridiculous fan of Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire. Maybe you'll see my tattoo from the novels. MAYBE NOT.

My favorite all time place to travel is South Lake Tahoe. I grew up going there every year, and it just doesn't get any better than that. There is something particularly magnificent about its smell. Pine trees are my favorite. You might notice that in my tree-themed library/entryway. I love trees. I just got a pine-tree tattoo. PNW and Lake Tahoe love for life.

Places I've traveled to: Caribbean, France, Spain, Italy, Monaco, Israel, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, Grand Canyon, Disneyland, Disney World, Chicago, Boston, Vancouver, BC, Portland, OR, Ukraine, Austria, Hungary, Thailand, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Iceland, South Africa (I visited a past Airbnb guest! Spoiler: He broke my heart. Fun game: Guess who it was based on the reviews.), Samoa, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Bali, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Romania, Turkey, and Denmark. --phew! That took a lot of typing.

Places I've lived: Sacramento, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, Maui (3 months counts, right?), and Seattle, WA.

I don't have five things I can't live without. I have one. And that is my smart phone. I will die before I give it up. It is always within a foot of me, and I feel lost without it.

As a host, I hope I'm welcoming and provide a few laughs and fantastic food recommendations. Or we might not even meet. It all depends on the day! My full-time job is unpredictable. My house may not be the place for you if you depend on having a host there all the time to make you breakfast or turn your bed down at night. I can either be the busiest person or the biggest couch potato in the world. Next week, I'm working 12-14 hours every day. The week after, not so much.

Cool fact: I could say ""hello,"" ""goodbye,"" ""thank you,"" and the number 2 in 5-10 languages. I was that awesome. But now I'm not as awesome and lost this skill. Help me learn again? Julie.365.weekend on insta.",100,78

Both of us work at a local aerospace company that is occasionally in the news.  Our mellow and respectful kids are 15 (girl) and 13 (boy).

Our story: we lifted this house over 10 years ago and put a brand new, legal accessory dwelling unit (apartment) under it.  It is an above-ground apartment that has great views and gets great natural light (for Seattle, anyway).  We live in the 2 floors above. The apartment worked great as a long-term rental (4 sets of very satisfied tenants), but now we like using the space at certain times of the year; hence, Airbnb.  While we are relaxed and sociable, we are very conscious of your privacy! 

This place is a great spot for enjoying the lake and is a short jaunt to UW or downtown (and is also on the route of the Microsoft Connector -- feel free to ask about Corporate Housing / extended stays).

Our goal when traveling was to ""live like a local""--shop at the local markets, walk to nearby cafes, restaurants, catch a local live show, and enjoy the nature at each destination we visited. 

When we built our dream home, we immediately knew we had to allocate a space that would become a future Beach escape for others to enjoy.  We find ourselves enjoying every minute of hosting & one of our favorite aspects of being an AIRBNB host is the ability to meet colorful people from all corners of the world, helping them get acquainted with our community. It's because of our past travels through AIRBNB that piqued our love for hosting and sharing the local living of West Seattle & Alki-- we can't wait to welcome you to our little Beach oasis! 

In February of 2016, we took a year off work to travel the world, using Paris as our home base and hub to venture off to other parts of Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. We returned home to Alki in February of 2017, and welcomed our daughter that same year. Our second daughter joined our hosting home in 2020, just before the pandemic happened! So we're now on another adventure- hoping between home here in West Seattle and other parts of the world (as Covid will allow).

I have always had a great appreciation for architecture, so it was only natural that I was happy to become the manager for this beautiful home in West Seattle for my friends Shanna & Brandon!

Friends who know me know that I love being a steward to houses, even working by day for a house moving company where we save full-sized Craftsman-style homes by physically *moving* them from one place to another (by land or by barge). Nickel Bros house moves have been featured on Home & Garden TV's shows ""Haulin' House,"" and on Discovery and National Geographic Channels' ""Monster Moves.""

My goal is to make your stay at the ""Architect's Gem"" one of the best you've ever had!

— Jeff

About Owners: Brandon & Shanna

A family of Architects (plus two kids), we are live a bi-coastal existence. We started our architecture firm about 13 years ago, and we've enjoyed fantastic growth, designing Green homes and Live/Work urban condominiums and apartment units throughout the Seattle area. We are proud to have contributed to the built-space of Seattle in a positive, forward-thinking way, and one of the first places we started was renovating our own home — which you can now enjoy.

Why West Seattle:

We *love* our West Seattle home, and because we are architects we've been able to add to the home's charm over the years as we've lived in it. The house itself is a classic 1917 Bungalow, but we've added some great usable space and functionality, with an open kitchen design and warm and inviting touches architectural details. We were drawn to West Seattle because of the wonderful, varied and diverse individual urban neighborhoods that West Seattle has to offer: Admiral District (where we are); Alki Beach (must-see); Alaska Junction (the main urban core); Morgan Junction (great pub and restaurants); Fauntleroy/Endolyne (Ferry to Vashon and Peninsula, great restaurants); Westwood Village (convenient 'town centre' mall). We think you will really enjoy this comfortable and inviting house!

The Unique Benefits at this House:
 
Our home is one that you will immediately feel 'at home' with. We've designed the flow to give you both open and public spaces, as well as private nooks and quiet places to rest and relax. Fall deeply into the comfortable master bed and open up your book, or enjoy entertaining with friends or family during your stay in the large open kitchen and family room. Walk a few short blocks to the nearby pubs, bars, and restaurants, enjoy a jaunt down to Alki Beach for a nice Mexican meal at Cactus! and take a walk along the boardwalk after your dessert. During the day you can rent bikes or rollerblades and ride along the longest boardwalk (walking and biking path) in Seattle. Visit Salty's restaurant on Harbor Avenue overlooking the Seattle skyline, or even rent scuba gear and scuba dive with the local in the Elliott Bay. Or, if you want to tour the Pike Place Market by day or enjoy the Seattle nightlife downtown, hop in your car and in 13 minutes (during light traffic) you will be downtown! Take a longer ride out to Snoqualmie Pass for skiing during the winter, or hike, climb, kayak, or sail your way through the summer months in the greater Seattle area.

We are thrilled to share our private backyard cottage, Baker Cottage, and our mother-in-law garden apartment, The Baker, with our guests, along with the experience of living in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. We love walking to local shops and restaurants, farmer's markets, the ease of access to downtown and Pike Market, amazing hiking trails, micro breweries and of course, our favorite Seattle coffee shops.
We built the cottage as an independent vacation and rental unit so that guests have a quiet, private spot during their stay. 
The Baker, located in the mother in law apartment of our main house, is the perfect chic urban getaway.  
While we honor our guest's privacy, we are always available via text or phone, and happy to provide you with restaurant or sightseeing recommendations.

Not only do we follow CDC guidelines of cleaning and disinfecting, we allow for 3 days between guest visits.  

My partner Jeff and I also have a passion for stories (films, books, and good conversations). We will be happy to tell you about the newest indie film which we just saw at Seattle International Film Festival. We are explorers of new places (restaurants, theaters, music venues, bars, beaches, and parks) and fiercely loyal to the tried and true. Again, happy to direct you to both. 

As for the books you will find in The Library, please feel free to take a book and/or leave a book. 

In our spare time, we also run an upcycling business - Barrett Street Upcyclers. I take gently worn men's button down shirts and make them into pillows, tote bags and wine sleeves.

I am retired, and am usually home, so if there is anything you need, I’m always happy to assist. I can also help you navigate the area, and discuss your itinerary with suggestions and ideas, to make the most of your time in Seattle. 

I have been told numerous times from guests that “this is not your normal or ordinary Airbnb,” which I consider to be a compliment. If you are an art appreciator, have an artistic flair, or simply want to engage your senses, you just may enjoy staying here. I have lived in Seattle over 42 years; all of which were in Queen Anne, which is unmistakably the finest, and most highly sought after location in Seattle. It’s a very quiet neighborhood, filled with charming turn of the century homes, (except for mine which is contemporary) and there are no apartment buildings, or developments, which adds to the serenity of the area. Bigelow Ave is a historical street, lined with huge trees, and a viewpoint one block from me that is a major viewing area for the 4th of July fireworks, and is a primary stop for tour buses. It overlooks Lake Union, which is filled with boats, houseboats, Cascade mountain view’s, and is where the houseboat that was instrumental in the movie “Sleepless in Seattle” was filmed. 

If you stroll down Bigelow Ave, you will find many city views.  I’m located one mile from Seattle Center and two miles from downtown. The bus which takes you directly to both locations, and is one block from my home. The majority of the attractions are very close to my home, so unless you plan day trips, you won’t need a car. I can direct you how to get to my home from the airport by public transportation which is simple; one train and one bus ride, and it’ll be less than $6 per person. 

Queen Anne Avenue is eight blocks away, which has dozens of dining choices, bars, shops, banks, Trader Joe’s, Safeway, a drug store, and many restaurants offer outdoor dining. In the colder months, the outside secluded personal booths have heaters. 

If you prefer a sparse, refined, buttoned-down, or minimalistic setting, this is not the home for you, and it would be best for you to secure other lodging. This home is the embodiment of a modern, cool, and trendy abode, in combination with a chill and relaxed attitude. 

However, if you want to visit Seattle, and stay at my home; there is virtually nothing that you need to bring, except your clothes, and if you need robes, coats, or jackets, I have plenty of them available. The bedroom and bathroom are filled with absolutely everything that you may need, or not even realize that you may need, and every possible convenience is contained within your space, as well as the coziness and comforts that will contribute to ensuring that you have the best experience possible. 

I am a world traveler and I understand the importance of a quiet, comfortable, cozy, and inviting atmosphere after a day of traveling, driving, flying, touring, sightseeing, visiting with family and friends, and dealing with crowds, traffic, and lines during high tourist season. 
If you are arriving by car, there is always ample free parking on my block; one of the last neighborhoods in Seattle with this luxury. If you need your laundry done, before, during, or when you depart, I will do it for you. 

If you stay at my home, you will be welcomed with gracious hospitality, elegant sheets, goose down and multiple Tempurpedic pillows, a large closet, an aromatherapy diffuser, and a sound machine with many possible water choices; rain, two surf modes, thunderstorm, pond, white noise, and it can also be customized to add the sound of frogs, owls, birds, etc. 

The room is fully inclusive, and you will find, robes, a heated towel warmer, an abundance of emollients for both men and women, a blow dryer, a flat iron, a curling iron, an assortment of hair products, toothpaste, toothbrushes, dental floss, Q-tips, cotton balls, toothpicks, pain relievers, and a private bathrooms stocked with everything you could possibly need. There is a large assortment of body washes, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, and potions. Also, an assortment of skin care products for men. I’ve been told many times by guests after they have arrived home, that now their husbands, partners, boyfriends, or male friends, are hooked, and are now indulging in self care skin and body care products. A weighted blanket and a relaxing foot massager is also available. 

It also has several dimmable steampunk fixtures, a Keurig coffee machine with a huge assortment of coffee. I always make sure the room has snacks, chocolate, candy, a mini fridge, a microwave, and an antique ice chest which is full of dishes, utensils, glasses, wine glasses, a corkscrew, dozens of tea choices, napkins, go cups, and basically anything you may need. The room also has a leather love seat, a desk, and a large Samsung HD TV with Netflix, HBO, Showtime and many other choices. I will welcome you with wine or beer upon your arrival if you choose to indulge. 

The bedroom will pamper you with soothing comforts, a king size Temperpedic bed whcih adjusted for both your bed and your feet, a heated mattress pad to ensure you’ll be toasty when you crawl in bed in the cooler climates, which is dual controlled and has three heating zones, so you can customize where you want heat to be distributed. For the warmer months, the house has a brand new air conditioning system, and a Dyson tower fan for the room. I’ve been told so many times that the space is like a spa, and that I have comforts that the guests didn’t realize even existed. 
I have volunteered at the Seattle Animal Shelter for over 14 years as their official mascot at sporting, fundraising, and adoption events. It's always a thrill giving hugs and high-fives to kids and adults alike, not to mention hundreds of selfies as Fido the bloodhound.

I have a 15 year old yorkie, and a six year old Lhasa Apso. I also have a 22 year old African Grey parrot, who speaks and mimics, however she is on the main floor, and your space is on the 2nd floor. Your pets are always welcome in my home.

Seattle was the first state in 2014 to legalize both pot and gay marriage, and is extremely liberal.  If you choose to smoke, I simply ask that you do it outside on my porch, or you can walk one block to the amazing viewpoint where there is seating.",100,100

I absolutely love living in the PNW with all its natural beauty and opportunity to indulge my passions. Seattle has so much to offer with events and places to explore. However, I am a desert girl at heart and regularly visit the SW for my Rocky Mountain fix. 

My passions include cooking, foraging, hiking, gardening, sailing, and knitting. I love tending my chickens and hiking with my dogs, Meg and Grady. But, most of all, I love meeting new people, getting to know them, and learning about all their adventures. As a former professional Personal and Executive assistant, I very much enjoy taking care of people and their needs. This is why I love being an Airbnb host. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than making a difference in peoples lives. I love cooking delicious meals for my guests and making sure they are comfortable and cozy in their suite. It is my goal as a host for my guests to leave here feeling more enriched by their experience. 

For my own enrichment I listen to a lot of audio books. I don't have much time to sit and read, so I listen while I work. I enjoy almost all genres, but I particularly enjoy historical fiction (Sharon Kay Penman, Edward Rutherford, Herman Wouk, Ken Follett) fantasy (Diana Gabaldon, Orson Scott Card, Jonathan Renshaw, Neil Gaimon, Dean Koontz, Robert McCammon), mystery (John LeCarre, Rhys Bowen, Jacqueline Winspear) and many others. A couple of my favorite books are ""East of Eden"" by John Steinbeck and ""The Good Earth"" by Pearl S. Buck. If you haven't read them, DO! 

I love to travel and a bike trip across France or Italy is in my bucket list. I'm not a ""fancy"" traveler and prefer the simple life. I love to camp and stay in rustic cabins. One of my favorite vacation spots is Iron Springs Resort. It is not rustic, but the cabins are nostalgic and comfortable. I have many good memories there. Another favorite spot is Lake Ozette in the Olympic National Forest. I had the best canoe camping trip there ever. Many of the campsites at Lake Ozette are only accessible by boat. It is a beautiful place and within hiking distance of ocean beaches. I love adventure and live by the motto ""Life is an adventure! Live it!!"". I hope you will come share some of your own adventures with me.

I know most of the great spots to experience a good bite or an amazing sunset. Jimi is originally from the Philippines and brings his amazing flair to our home. 

We started hosting people on airbnb because my father is half paralyzed.  We use the money from airbnb to help support him as he cannot support himself. So we treat every guest as the blessing they are, a helping hand to my father's better fortunes. We have recently added a few extra units to see if we can start a little boutique hotel. Even though our locations are expensive, our profits are not high. But our current goal is to get enough funds to supply a down payment to build a disability home for my father.

To that end we want all of our guests to have amazing experiences. We do whatever it takes to provide a wonderful trip, just ask and we provide.

Our goal when traveling was to ""live like a local""--shop at the local markets, walk to nearby cafes, restaurants, catch a local live show, and enjoy the nature at each destination we visited. 

When we built our dream home on Alki Beach, we immediately knew we had to allocate a space that would become a future Beach escape for others to enjoy.  We find ourselves enjoying every minute of hosting & one of our favorite aspects of being an AIRBNB host is the ability to meet colorful people from all corners of the world, helping them get acquainted with our communities. It's because of our past travels through AIRBNB that piqued our love for hosting.

In February of 2016, we took a year off work to travel the world, using Paris as our home base and hub to venture off to other parts of Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. We returned home to Alki in February of 2017, and welcomed our daughter that same year. Our second daughter joined our hosting home in 2020, just before the pandemic happened!

My wife and I are both sales professionals in the tech industry and medical field. Living in the Northwest, I am amazed everyday at the beauty of this city. There are not many cities where you can hike, ski, boat all within minutes from each other. I love to enjoy the outdoors with my family and especially love being on the water. In the summer time you will always find me on the water either on our boat, fishing or water skiing. In the winter, you will find me in the mountains skiing with my son and snowboarding. 

I am also a foodie with a love for amazing food and good wine. Being in Seattle, we are very fortunate to have both. 

Above all, my first and real love is my family. We love spending time together and taking trips. My wife's family is back east in Philadelphia, when we are not seeing them we do love to take long weekend trips to the San Juan Islands or down to Napa Valley wine country. 

My hope along with my wife is that anyone that stays with us can appreciate and truly see what beauty this city has to offer and we hope that they get to experience a little of it while staying with us. We hope that it all starts with our home and sharing it with you.",100,99

The Swanky Sexy B Treehouse was my first custom built home and I definitely designed with my favorite things in mind. I wanted a warm and cozy place of solitude with a great kitchen for cooking, an open space for entertaining/dining with family and friends that also had LOTS & LOTS of natural light.  This home has provided all of these things and then some for myself and the many others who have stayed here in the past.  If this is the type of space and energy that makes you FEEL and brings you happiness, it brings me as much happiness to be able to share it with you...and that's real talk!

After booking, guests of the Sexy B Treehouse will receive a code to access the home.  Instructions for wifi, cable tv, dishwasher, etc will be inside waiting for you. Basics such a shampoo, body wash, towels, coffee, sugar, spices (of course) will be provided as well as an empty growler or two should you want to try out any of the local breweries.  Your stay is all about you enjoying your time. Although I'm just a short 5 minutes away, I'll only contact you if you request it or if I have the misfortune of receiving a complaint from one of your neighbors.

After 10 years in New York City, we now spend most of our time in the pacific northwest with our beloved pup, Piper.  We have strong ties to NYC, and spend as much time there as we can.  Piper would love to be a world traveler, but gets to go to a doggie dude ranch instead, while we travel.   We are art collectors, gardeners and foodies.  We particularly like connecting to local cultures through visits to food markets, funky shops and taking cooking lessons.  

We have traveled extensively through out Central and South America.  Homestays in Guatemala (where we practice our rusty Spanish), hiking Torres del Paine in Chile, hiking the Inca Trail in Peru and snorkeling with the Galapagos penguins are highlights.  We've spent considerable amounts of time in SouthEast Asia...love Cambodia.  

We are energetic.  But being in our 40's we consider ourselves mellow travelers who appreciate connecting with the energy of the places we visit rather than racing from museum to museum.  We particularly appreciate hotels and flats with well thought out spaces with a soothing vibe.

We've lived in the Pritchard Beach neighborhood for 22 years and love the neighborhood more each year.  Amy is a theatre actor and professor of Shakespeare at the Universtiy of Washington and Hans is a general contractor in Seattle building new residential homes, micro houses and interesting spaces for forward-thinking clients.  We enjoy a large community of friends and spend a good deal of our time breaking bread with them.  This house was owned by our dear friends until recently (Hans built them a new house!) and we purchased it to have an extra place for our family, friends, travelers as well as a possible future home for Hans' family.  

As frequent Airbnbers ourselves (most often in Manzanita OR) we've always wanted to create a space of our own to share in this way.  Our post-kids-in-the-house lives will certainly include running an inn or B&B of some sort; we love nothing more than hosting friends and strangers and spreading love in our community during these complex and fraught times.

We believe our space will be a restful hideaway and during the sunny months our backyard will bring you an excellent place to soak up the vitamin D.

We are a safe space and welcome all.",100,100

We are the Blues! We are both CA natives, and moved up to Seattle for school and work. We love the PNW - the outdoors are at our fingertips here!

Laura works at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, supporting principal investigators at the Center for Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Josh is an architect designing educational architecture for schools throughout Seattle and the surrounding areas. When we're not working, we're either hiking, going to the movies, or hanging with our church community. 

We also LOVE to travel! Post graduation, Laura traveled for eleven months on a trip called the World Race, visiting a different country each month, doing various volunteer/service/mission work in each place. In that year we visited four continents, working in orphanages, teaching English, working in churches, clearing land, and connecting with communities all over the world! It certainly fueled a longing to explore, venture to new places, and experience new communities. But it has also grown an appreciation for a sense of ""home"" and comfort. Laura has visited 44 countries so far, and her dream would be to visit them all! 

We got married in April 2018, and spent our honeymoon in Chile - specifically the Patagonia region. When traveling, we're on the look out for the tastiest food spots, live music, best views, and any sort of fun, cultural events unique to that place. We hope to venture to many new places together. However, our newest adventure is hosting our very own Airbnb in partnership with the company, Loftium! 

We look forward to hosting you!

You can book airport / train / bus pick ups and drop (EMAIL HIDDEN) please enter airbnb as the referral to receive a discount.

We are open to any and all guests as along as everyone is respectful and polite.  Your race, sexual preference or religion is respected as long as you extend the same respect.

Thanks for checking out our profile! Originally from the Midwest, we sold everything we owned, loaded up a Uhaul trailer, and drove west to start a new adventure in Seattle. Wanting to write our own story, we were in search of something completely different from our hometowns in Wisconsin. The PNW felt like a great fit and off we went!

#Boeingbunker is the product of a vision inspired by Dave's interest in aviation (Dave is an aspiring pilot) and Martha's obsession with all things decorating (colors, texture, and patterns ... oh my!). With investment of our own sweat equity, #boeingbunker came to life over a six month period. In its beginning stages, we felt like it was such a big risk. Thanks to our guests and their invaluable feedback, #boeingbunker has been far more successful than we could have imagined. 

We've grown to love the PNW and can't wait to share our home with you!

I'm happy to give guidance about what you might be interested in seeing, doing, experiencing, if you'd like it. If you'd prefer to be left to your own devices, I respect that.  There are lots of different travel styles and what's important is that you are traveling.

I'm an educated professional but I prefer to be defined by the things I'm passionate about. Truth be told, I wish I traveled more and worked less.

Everything you could possibly need is within your grasp.  

Walking around the neighborhood is an adventure, so bring some comfortable walking shoes and plan on getting some exercise.  Taking in the many coffee shops, cafes, and boutiques in between you will see that Seattle has adapted to Covid-19 with outdoor seating at most restaurants or Take-Out ordering. If you ever have any questions, I am always a text away with an answer and a smile!

When I am not helping my clients in the apartment, I am helping people find their way in the world of real estate as a full-time Realtor.  It brings me great joy & fulfillment when I support my clients as they search to buy a new dream home or prepare their beloved family home to Sell to a new family. 

Whatever the reason in every season, I am committed to being of service & helping my clients with their real estate needs.

I enjoy meeting people and hearing what makes them tick. I love to travel,  study architecture, art, design, food, fashion, wine, and culture. 

Having a passion for helping find homeless animals their Furever Homes, know that a percentage of your fee is donated to local Animal Shelters & Rescue organizations across the US and internationally; the animals thank you!  

In my spare time, I am seen walking my two rescue pups, Charli & Bolty, in our beautiful Maple Leaf neighborhood, Maple Leaf park, or around Greenlake park! 

Last and certainly not least, I have a passion for volunteering with Habitat 4 Humanity! I love to learn new skills and I enjoy building homes for families in need; helping put a roof over a family's heads is one of the most rewarding experiences I have had and I highly recommend it! 

My philosophy is that life is one big Adventure novel made up of lots of little exciting chapters! 

We live and we learn… 

Everyone needs a home (while on the road) where they feel safe, they can hang their hat, relax & regroup for their next adventure!

We opened our homes 13 years ago to Airbnb and have been a 13th Level Airbnb Superhost. But, before that, we hosted international students pursuing their degrees in the US.

our recent criminal background since we are taking care of young international students ranging from ages 8-21 years old.  We have hosted children of CEO’s, lawyers, doctors, dentists, businessmen, and even professors from Banda Aceh in Indonesia who come here for an exchange partnership with EVCC!

I grew up in Seattle, and hold B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Washington. I have lived and traveled extensively throughout the Middle East, North Africa, Iran, and Europe.

The history of the Zawaideh clan is fascinating. My lineage can be traced back to the earliest roots of man in Yemen. My ancestors were among the first settled tribes to migrate from that area, moving northeast to what is now southern Iraq and later to what are now the modern countries of Jordan and Syria. 

You can read more about my family history in our Welcome Book during your stay. I come from a culture of hospitality and exploration, and I hope you will get a taste of that during your stay at the Caravan-Serai Inn.",100,100

It is very common to see our resident Eagles hunting or teaching their young ones to fly. 

We live in the main house with our adorable 3 year old puppy Remy, and our 2 year old tripod rescue, Sunny

I hope your stay in my house will do that and bring the best memories of what this beautiful paradise know as Seattle is all about!     

Luckily I found an amazing place to live by Capitol Hill, a vibrant area near fantastic restaurants, shops and bars, close to downtown and yet surprisingly quiet and safe. 

My house comprises three units: 2 studios that I airbnb and a main apartment where I live. The studios have independent access, providing 24hr access with a superb level of privacy and comfort.

I'm very relaxed, fun and easy going should you want meet me to give you advice on the area, grab coffee/drink or simply say hi.

I'm married to Dan, who works in the travel industry, and we have two awesome kids. Our roots go way back in the Pacific Northwest, but before settling in Seattle for good, we lived as far away as Amsterdam and Australia. We love our friendly, colorful, epicurean, walkable, bikeable, open-hearted neighborhood--and the truly spectacular region we're lucky to call home. Traveling the world with our kids, we've always looked for farm stays, fresh eggs, backyard goats, blooming gardens, and other features that keep us close to the refreshing magic of the natural world. In fact, it was an Airbnb host in Oregon (Sweet Springs Family Farm) who inspired us to add bunnies to our homestead, and an Airbnb host in France (Aux Fenêtres du Château) serving bitty brown speckled eggs at breakfast who kindled our interest in keeping a flock of quail at home in Seattle. We have always enjoyed hosting Airbnb guests over the years in our primary residence (Hummingbird House in Ballard) whenever we've taken off on family adventures. In summer 2021, after 9 precious years with our kids growing up side by side, our beloved next-door neighbors moved away.

It started out as an experiment, and we found that we love the process as both guest and hosts - whether you want a quiet retreat or a kitchen-table chat about the neighborhood, city, and your own adventures.

Being able to book a room has been so convenient while traveling, especially abroad. Super thankful to anyone willing to open their home/space on this platform as it gives me and many others a chance to meet and make new friends and travel efficiently. 

    I’ve learned so much about many different cultures around the world, and looking forward to many more experiences. I come from a Nigerian and Austrian background, definitely a BIG foodie and would be interested in learning about your culture too! (Also side note: open to trying new food as well lol) (: 

    I'm very laid back, an extroverted introvert, down to earth, and an animal lover. I have a quiet, super DUPER cute 10lbs Yorkie named Seven. I got him while staying in Milan, Italy and sometimes he travels with me, but I always let whomever I stay with know if he’s coming. 

  I am clean, quiet and respectful and I'm looking for a space that is just about the same and more. Hoping my host(s) are friendly, open, informative, respectful of space and laid back. Looking forward to staying!

However, we are still fairly new to Airbnb so we’d love any suggestions on how we can make our property even more welcoming and comfortable for you.

Seattle's musical heritage is remarkable, and I'm proud to have been a part of it for over two decades. My husband Sky and I bought a unique, but run-down corner property in White Center in 2017. We fell in love with it because of it's proximity to a natural area, directly next to us on two sides, and teeming with wildlife. Our goal was to renovate the attached one bedroom mother-in-law and to build new construction for a one bedroom in the garage underneath. We have currently accomplished one of these goals, the brand new one bedroom that used be a garage, and are beyond excited to finally share it with you!  We did the majority of the work ourselves, (thanks, Youtube and Pinterest!), with the help of professionals, of course, for the important stuff.  It's been an arduous road, but we are delighted with the result and confident you will be too!",100,100
